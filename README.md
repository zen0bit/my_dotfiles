## Openbox WM

This is the openbox window manager. just for fun, i was trying to create my own custom ubuntu based iso 8 months ago. i successfully made that iso with this beautiful openbox desktop, dude that custom OS of mine was/is awesome, however i never get a chance to shared that iso. i named that "OPENUNIX" (Open for openbox & Unix came form LINUX). Anyway, may be i'll share that iso after i made it based on ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
